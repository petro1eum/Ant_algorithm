# Ant Colony Optimization for the Traveling Salesman Problem

This document outlines the implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method tailored to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## Overview

The **Traveling Salesman Problem** involves determining the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the origin city.

**Ant Colony Optimization** is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, where ants deposit pheromones along their path to guide other ants. Paths with higher concentrations of pheromones become more attractive, leading to a form of indirect communication among ants.

## Algorithm Description

The Ant Colony Algorithm is executed as follows:

1. **Initialization:** Set up initial parameters, including distances between cities and pheromone levels.
2. **Ant Loop:**
   - Each ant starts its journey from a random city.
   - It selects the next city based on probabilities calculated from the distances and pheromone levels, utilizing functions like `desire` and `next_city`.
   - The next city is chosen using a "roulette wheel" method (`roulette_run`), where cities with higher desirability have greater chances of selection.
   - This process repeats until the ant has visited all cities.
3. **Route Evaluation:** Once all ants have finished their tours, the length of each route is computed using the `travel_calc` function.
4. **Best Route Selection:** The optimal routes are recorded in a `distance_list`.
5. **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2-4 for a predetermined number of iterations to refine the solution.

## Outcome

The algorithm aims to approximate the solution to the TSP by minimizing the total length of the route. The effectiveness of the solution is contingent upon several factors, including the number of iterations, the number of ants, and the specific algorithm parameters.

## Conclusion

The Ant Colony Optimization method is a metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by natural phenomena. It proves effective for graph-based optimization problems like the TSP, shortest path finding, and others.
